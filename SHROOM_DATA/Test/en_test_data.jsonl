{"index": "en-tst-0", "title": "Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method", "abstract": "As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score.We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text. Experimental results on English-language benchmarks and PatentMIA demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods.

{"index": "en-tst-1", "title": "Formality is Favored: Unraveling the Learning Preferences of Large Language Models on Data with Conflicting Knowledge", "abstract": "Having been trained on massive pretraining data, large language models have shown excellent performance on many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, pretraining data tends to contain misleading and even conflicting information, and it is intriguing to understand how LLMs handle these noisy data during training. In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs’ learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by manipulating the degree of consistency with the majority data.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.304", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.304.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile":

On image transcreation for cultural relevance", "abstract": "Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.

SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub-problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios.

We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM’s ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff’s alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B with constrained decoding scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared the depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4 stories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from highly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit.

Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation of compositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions rather than models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme — a procedure for transforming examples into other well-formed examples — that imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same task. We describe a procedure called LexSym that discovers these transformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinary neural sequence models. Unlike existing compositional data augmentation procedures, LexSym can be deployed agnostically across text, structured data, and even images.

These tasks encapsulate progressively more sophisticated aspects of “understanding” a cartoon; key elements are the complex, often surprising relationships between images and captions and the frequent inclusion of indirect and playful allusions to human experience and culture. We investigate both multimodal and language-only models: the former are challenged with the cartoon images directly, while the latter are given multifaceted descriptions of the visual scene to simulate human-level visual understanding. We find that both types of models struggle at all three tasks. For example, our best multimodal models fall 30 accuracy points behind human performance on the matching task, and, even when provided ground-truth visual scene descriptors, human-authored explanations are preferred head-to-head over the best machine-authored ones (few-shot GPT-4) in more than 2/3 of cases.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics.

Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text.

{"index": "en-tst-39", "title": "Exploring How Generative Adversarial Networks Learn Phonological Representations", "abstract": "This paper explores how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) learn representations of phonological phenomena. We analyze how GANs encode contrastive and non-contrastive nasality in French and English vowels by applying the ciwGAN architecture (Begus, 2021). Begus claims that ciwGAN encodes linguistically meaningful representations with categorical variables in its latent space and manipulating the latent variables shows an almost one to one corresponding control of the phonological features in ciwGAN’s generated outputs. However, our results show an interactive effect of latent variables on the features in the generated outputs, which suggests the learned representations in neural networks are different from the phonological representations proposed by linguists.

Yet, there have been few systematic investigations into the ability of large language models (LLMs) to track discourse entities. In this work, we present a task probing to what extent a language model can infer the final state of an entity given an English description of the initial state and a series of state-changing operations. We use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking. Taken together, these results suggest that language models can learn to track entities but pretraining on text corpora alone does not make this capacity surface.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.213", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.213.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Najoung", "last": "Kim"}, {"first": "Sebastian", "last": "Schuster"}], "question": "Name the three models which were used for the work.", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Entity Tracking in Language Models\" by Kim,Najoung  et al., name the three models which were used for the work.", "output_text": "The article is about Entity Tracking in Language Models, and the authors propose a new method for Entity Tracking in Language Models.", "output_tokens": ["<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "The", "▁article", "▁is", "▁about", "▁Entity", "▁Track", "ing", "▁in", "▁Language", "▁Mod", "els", ",", "▁and", "▁the", "▁authors", "▁propose", "▁a", "▁new", "▁method", "▁for", "▁Entity", "▁Track", "ing", "▁in", "▁Language", "▁Mod", "els", ".", "</s>"], "output_logits": [17.5226345062, 15.6258506775, 14.642780304, 17.6870880127, 17.8809967041, 15.9417095184, 16.2053604126, 24.275718689, 25.9354286194, 22.917432785, 22.8659706116, 25.1984386444, 26.8636703491, 21.4080314636, 16.479549408, 18.8906364441, 18.6568012238, 17.4736251831, 20.8087081909, 17.0399284363, 17.3289222717, 21.5341415405, 16.5474224091, 22.3978729248, 24.9612426758, 21.1175098419, 17.4173374176, 24.406665802, 27.6114120483, 22.6145534515, 19.5922164917]}

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training.

A case study on the challenging problem of knowledge base question answering (KBQA), which features a massive environment, demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and flexibility of Pangu: A BERT-base LM is sufficient for setting a new record on standard KBQA datasets, and larger LMs further bring substantial gains.Pangu also enables, for the first time, effective few-shot in-context learning for KBQA with large LMs such as Codex.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.270", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.270.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yu", "last": "Gu"}, {"first": "Xiang", "last": "Deng"}, {"first": "Yu", "last": "Su"}], "question": "What is the full form of KBQA?", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Don’t Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments\" by Gu,Yu  et al., what is the full form of KBQA?", "output_text": "KBQA stands for Knowledge-Based Question Answering.", "output_tokens": ["<0x0A>", "K", "B", "Q", "A", "▁stands", "▁for", "▁Know", "ledge", "-", "B", "ased", "▁Question", "▁Answer", "ing", ".", "</s>"], "output_logits": [21.2863121033, 13.6044006348, 17.4454135895, 20.8067703247, 22.7043151855, 22.1189918518, 26.3748455048, 18.6073818207, 23.5298194885, 20.672542572, 23.5102596283, 25.9436473846, 19.0816764832, 22.3255939484, 26.1739997864, 23.0210437775, 25.3410758972]}

However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection.

By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average.

We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics.

While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.

By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average.

By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.

To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps.

The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations. The resulting model, namely Distribution Edited Model (DEM), is cheaper than standard data mixing and outperforms strong baselines on a variety of benchmarks, yielding upto 6.2% improvement on MMLU, 11.5% on BBH, 16.1% on DROP, 6% MathQA and 9.3% on HELM with models of size 3B to 13B.

{"index": "en-tst-122", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Richeek", "last": "Das"}, {"first": "Sahasra", "last": "Ranjan"}, {"first": "Shreya", "last": "Pathak"}, {"first": "Preethi", "last": "Jyothi"}], "question": "Name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "default", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP\" by Das,Richeek  et al., name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "output_text": "(The article is available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14860>).", "output_tokens": ["<0x0A>", "▁(", "The", "▁article", "▁is", "▁available", "▁at", "▁<", "https", "://", "ar", "xiv", ".", "org", "/", "abs", "/", "2", "0", "0", "6", ".", "1", "4", "8", "6", "0", ">", ").", "</s>"], "output_logits": [20.6184158325, 11.496679306, 12.0380992889, 18.2295436859, 18.6069850922, 14.7612314224, 23.6894569397, 16.5917549133, 19.9343338013, 22.334312439, 16.7144966125, 27.0367202759, 24.5445747375, 24.4886226654, 23.4719429016, 23.7062549591, 22.7242240906, 19.6979751587, 22.3103790283, 17.5486106873, 19.0442771912, 25.4199867249, 19.55260849, 20.44962883, 18.742931366, 15.5842227936, 18.0904197693, 18.3841342926, 17.9775695801, 22.3529396057]}

It is significant to explore whether Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) know and understand such knowledge. However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge, lacking a system- atic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic un- derstanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning.

Yet, there have been few systematic investigations into the ability of large language models (LLMs) to track discourse entities.

We use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking.

In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, Coscript, which consists of 55,000 scripts.

While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop.

{"index": "en-tst-149", "title": "DEM: Distribution Edited Model for Training with Mixed Data Distributions", "abstract": "Training with mixed data distributions is a common and important part of creating multi-task and instruction-following models. The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations.

{"index": "en-tst-166", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Richeek", "last": "Das"}, {"first": "Sahasra", "last": "Ranjan"}, {"first": "Shreya", "last": "Pathak"}, {"first": "Preethi", "last": "Jyothi"}], "question": "Name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "default", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP\" by Das,Richeek  et al., name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).

{"index": "en-tst-176", "title": "Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method", "abstract": "As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score.We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text. Experimental results on English-language benchmarks and PatentMIA demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods.

However, pretraining data tends to contain misleading and even conflicting information, and it is intriguing to understand how LLMs handle these noisy data during training. In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs’ learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by manipulating the degree of consistency with the majority data.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.304", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.304.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile":

Finding an optimal portfolio of retrieved items is a combinatorial optimization problem, generally considered NP-hard. This approach provides a learned approximation to such a solution, meeting specific task requirements under a given family of large language models (LLMs). We propose a training procedure based on reinforcement learning, incorporating feedback from LLMs. We instantiate an iterative retriever for composing in-context learning (ICL) exemplars and apply it to various semantic parsing tasks that demand synthesized programs as outputs. By adding only 4M additional parameters for state encoding, we convert an off-the-shelf dense retriever into a stateful iterative retriever, outperforming previous methods in selecting ICL exemplars on semantic parsing datasets such as CalFlow, TreeDST, and MTOP. Additionally, the trained iterative retriever generalizes across different inference LLMs beyond the one used during training.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.406", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.406.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yunmo", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Tongfei", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Harsh", "last": "Jhamtani"}, {"first": "Patrick", "last": "Xia"}, {"first": "Richard", "last": "Shin"}, {"first": "Jason", "last": "Eisner"}, {"first": "Benjamin", "last": "Van Durme"}], "question": "What is the full form of MDP?", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Learning to Retrieve Iteratively for In-Context Learning\" by Chen,Yunmo  et al., what is the full form of MDP?", "output_text": "(The article can be found at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14798>)The full form of MDP is Markov Decision Process.", "output_tokens": ["<0x0A>", "▁(", "The", "▁article", "▁can", "▁be", "▁found", "▁at", "▁<", "https", "://", "ar", "xiv", ".", "org", "/", "abs", "/", "2", "0", "0", "6", ".", "1", "4", "7", "9", "8", ">)", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "The", "▁full", "▁form", "▁of", "▁M", "DP", "▁is", "▁Mark", "ov", "▁Dec", "ision", "▁Process", ".", "</s>"], "output_logits": [21.2748756409, 12.9783992767, 12.2371807098, 15.6277265549, 18.7930793762, 26.3007602692, 23.2586708069, 24.3074512482, 18.65625, 20.7170753479, 23.4438858032, 17.3982448578, 26.8169212341, 24.4192123413, 24.7879104614, 24.7811794281, 23.8633308411, 23.2125091553, 19.3669433594, 24.348285675, 18.9972324371, 20.7136611938, 26.6525630951, 19.7114753723, 20.8777732849, 20.2642688751, 17.9246788025, 16.4705982208, 18.883392334, 22.901473999, 23.6601467133, 17.0588607788, 16.9123859406, 23.0402793884, 25.0486793518, 22.4715480804, 26.215877533, 23.1639194489, 18.2978935242, 24.1123733521, 25.104888916, 25.1647949219, 29.0067405701, 25.7851104736, 25.8083534241]}

Our experiments demonstrate the value of modeling OATH-Frames over existing sentiment and toxicity classifiers.

We propose FBI, a novel framework designed to examine the proficiency of Evaluator LLMs in assessing four critical abilities in other LLMs: factual accuracy, instruction following, coherence in long-form writing, and reasoning proficiency. By introducing targeted perturbations in answers generated by LLMs, that clearly impact one of these key capabilities, we test whether an Evaluator LLM can detect these quality drops. By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average.

{"index": "en-tst-208", "title": "LexSym: Compositionality as Lexical Symmetry", "abstract": "In tasks like semantic parsing, instruction following, and question answering, standard deep networks fail to generalize compositionally from small datasets. Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation of compositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions rather than models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme — a procedure for transforming examples into other well-formed examples — that imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same task.

{"index": "en-tst-210", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Richeek", "last": "Das"}, {"first": "Sahasra", "last": "Ranjan"}, {"first": "Shreya", "last": "Pathak"}, {"first": "Preethi", "last": "Jyothi"}], "question": "Name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP\" by Das,Richeek  et al., name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "output_text": "(The article is not available online, so I cannot provide a link to the article.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

{"index": "en-tst-213", "title": "Faithful Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation through Cycle Training", "abstract": "Methods to generate text from structured data have advanced significantly in recent years, primarily due to fine-tuning of pre-trained language models on large datasets. However, such models can fail to produce output faithful to the input data, particularly on out-of-domain data. Sufficient annotated data is often not available for specific domains, leading us to seek an unsupervised approach to improve the faithfulness of output text. Since the problem is fundamentally one of consistency between the representations of the structured data and text, we evaluate the effectiveness of cycle training in this work. Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text.

It is significant to explore whether Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) know and understand such knowledge. However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge, lacking a system- atic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic un- derstanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning.

We analyze how GANs encode contrastive and non-contrastive nasality in French and English vowels by applying the ciwGAN architecture (Begus, 2021). Begus claims that ciwGAN encodes linguistically meaningful representations with categorical variables in its latent space and manipulating the latent variables shows an almost one to one corresponding control of the phonological features in ciwGAN’s generated outputs. However, our results show an interactive effect of latent variables on the features in the generated outputs, which suggests the learned representations in neural networks are different from the phonological representations proposed by linguists. On the other hand, ciwGAN is able to distinguish contrastive and noncontrastive features in English and French by encoding them differently. Comparing the performance of GANs learning from different languages results in a better understanding of what language specific features contribute to developing language specific phonological representations.

In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, Coscript, which consists of 55,000 scripts.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training.

Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding.

Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Richeek", "last": "Das"}, {"first": "Sahasra", "last": "Ranjan"}, {"first": "Shreya", "last": "Pathak"}, {"first": "Preethi", "last": "Jyothi"}], "question": "Name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "model_id": "lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP\" by Das,Richeek  et al., name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics.

However, pretraining data tends to contain misleading and even conflicting information, and it is intriguing to understand how LLMs handle these noisy data during training. In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs’ learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by manipulating the degree of consistency with the majority data.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.304", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.304.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile":

{"index": "en-tst-269", "title": "An image speaks a thousand words, but can everyone listen? On image transcreation for cultural relevance", "abstract": "Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.

{"index": "en-tst-271", "title": "SUPER: Evaluating Agents on Setting Up and Executing Tasks from Research Repositories", "abstract": "Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in writing code, can they now be used to autonomously reproduce results from research repositories? Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub-problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development.

These variations may also be caused by transcreation, an adaptation process that entails more than transliteration and word-for-word translation. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-cultural translation on two fronts: (i) we introduce XC-Translate, the first large-scale, manually-created benchmark for machine translation that focuses on text that contains potentially culturally-nuanced entity names, and (ii) we propose KG-MT, a novel end-to-end method to integrate information from a multilingual knowledge graph into a neural machine translation model by leveraging a dense retrieval mechanism. Our experiments and analyses show that current machine translation systems and large language models still struggle to translate texts containing entity names, whereas KG-MT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, obtaining a 129% and 62% relative improvement compared to NLLB-200 and GPT-4, respectively.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.914", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.914.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Simone", "last": "Conia"}, {"first": "Daniel", "last": "Lee"}, {"first": "Min", "last": "Li"}, {"first": "Umar Farooq", "last": "Minhas"}, {"first": "Saloni", "last": "Potdar"}, {"first": "Yunyao", "last": "Li"}], "question": "XC-Translate, the manually-created benchmark for crosscultural translation covers how many languages?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Towards Cross-Cultural Machine Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Multilingual Knowledge Graphs\" by Conia,Simone  et al., xc-Translate, the manually-created benchmark for crosscultural translation covers how many languages?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Towards Cross-Cultural Machine Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Multilingual Knowledge Graphs\" by Conia, Simone et al., the manually-created benchmark for cross-cultural translation, xc-Translate, covers 14 languages.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Towards", "ĠCross", "-C", "ultural", "ĠMachine", "ĠTranslation", "Ġwith", "ĠRetrie", "val", "-Aug", "mented", "ĠGeneration", "Ġfrom", "ĠMult", "ilingual", "ĠKnowledge", "ĠGraph", "s", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠCon", "ia", ",", "ĠSimone", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "Ġthe", "Ġmanually", "-created", "Ġbenchmark", "Ġfor", "Ġcross", "-cultural", "Ġtranslation", ",", "Ġxc", "-", "Translate", ",", "Ġcovers", "Ġ", "14", "Ġlanguages", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [28.1245326996, 30.8652114868, 29.1367664337, 25.6112613678, 28.1079826355, 32.7294464111, 38.4591140747, 38.1314849854, 33.8002815247, 36.5095710754, 33.0870170593, 36.9988670349, 32.9407958984, 29.9648571014, 37.4191856384, 35.1028785706, 34.6908798218, 36.5698242188, 37.9830627441, 35.3039398193, 33.384979248, 31.9851398468, 37.1608695984, 35.0181541443, 28.859249115, 27.6057109833, 28.2193775177, 28.00207901, 26.7555065155, 28.1168289185, 34.3526649475, 29.8128452301, 21.9894752502, 21.9991779327, 33.0549430847, 28.6730365753, 25.7666168213, 28.7829818726, 32.5628814697, 33.4207572937, 25.8617420197, 21.8501605988, 26.6652164459, 27.8989315033, 29.3016834259, 28.7865180969, 24.7950839996, 23.2240848541, 25.1730747223, 24.9349842072, 23.8196983337]}

This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.

Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1051", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1051.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Maxime Guillaume", "last": "Kayser"}, {"first": "Bayar", "last": "Menzat"}, {"first": "Cornelius", "last": "Emde"}, {"first": "Bogdan Alexandru", "last": "Bercean"}, {"first": "Alex", "last": "Novak"}, {"first": "Abdalá Trinidad Espinosa", "last": "Morgado"}, {"first": "Bartlomiej", "last": "Papiez"}, {"first": "Susanne", "last": "Gaube"}, {"first": "Thomas", "last": "Lukasiewicz"}, {"first": "Oana-Maria", "last": "Camburu"}], "question": "How many cases were selected from the annotated 160 cases?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Fool Me Once?

{"index": "en-tst-281", "title": "DEM: Distribution Edited Model for Training with Mixed Data Distributions", "abstract": "Training with mixed data distributions is a common and important part of creating multi-task and instruction-following models. The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations. The resulting model, namely Distribution Edited Model (DEM), is cheaper than standard data mixing and outperforms strong baselines on a variety of benchmarks, yielding upto 6.2% improvement on MMLU, 11.5% on BBH, 16.1% on DROP, 6% MathQA and 9.3% on HELM with models of size 3B to 13B.

We advocate a careful approach to evaluating these interventions to ensure alignment with human values.In a case study of journalistic coverage of press releases, we assemble a large dataset of 250k press releases and 650k articles covering them. We develop methods to identify news articles that _challenge and contextualize_ press releases. Finally, we evaluate suggestions made by LLMs for these articles and compare these with decisions made by human journalists. Our findings are three-fold: (1) Human-written news articles that challenge and contextualize press releases more take more creative angles and use more informational sources.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women. These representational harms have concerning implications for downstream applications like story generation.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.84", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.84.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Myra", "last": "Cheng"}, {"first": "Esin", "last": "Durmus"}, {"first": "Dan", "last": "Jurafsky"}], "question": "Name the 5 races/ethnicities on which the work focus.

{"index": "en-tst-301", "title": "Faithful Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation through Cycle Training", "abstract": "Methods to generate text from structured data have advanced significantly in recent years, primarily due to fine-tuning of pre-trained language models on large datasets. However, such models can fail to produce output faithful to the input data, particularly on out-of-domain data. Sufficient annotated data is often not available for specific domains, leading us to seek an unsupervised approach to improve the faithfulness of output text. Since the problem is fundamentally one of consistency between the representations of the structured data and text, we evaluate the effectiveness of cycle training in this work. Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text. We show that cycle training, when initialized with a small amount of supervised data (100 samples in our case), achieves nearly the same performance as fully supervised approaches for the data-to-text generation task on the WebNLG, E2E, WTQ, and WSQL datasets. We perform extensive empirical analysis with automated evaluation metrics and a newly designed human evaluation schema to reveal different cycle training strategies’ effectiveness of reducing various types of generation errors.

We analyze how GANs encode contrastive and non-contrastive nasality in French and English vowels by applying the ciwGAN architecture (Begus, 2021). Begus claims that ciwGAN encodes linguistically meaningful representations with categorical variables in its latent space and manipulating the latent variables shows an almost one to one corresponding control of the phonological features in ciwGAN’s generated outputs. However, our results show an interactive effect of latent variables on the features in the generated outputs, which suggests the learned representations in neural networks are different from the phonological representations proposed by linguists. On the other hand, ciwGAN is able to distinguish contrastive and noncontrastive features in English and French by encoding them differently. Comparing the performance of GANs learning from different languages results in a better understanding of what language specific features contribute to developing language specific phonological representations. We also discuss the role of training data frequencies in phonological feature learning.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.175", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.175.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Jingyi", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Micha", "last": "Elsner"}], "question": "How many sentences are there in the TIMIT corpus?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Exploring How Generative Adversarial Networks Learn Phonological Representations\" by Chen,Jingyi  et al., how many sentences are there in the TIMIT corpus?", "output_text": "I'm happy to help!

Each utterance is around 3-6 seconds long, and it's a single sentence or a short phrase.If you're looking for the total number of sentences in the TIMIT corpus, it's difficult to provide an exact count, as some utterances may be shorter or longer than a single sentence.

{"index": "en-tst-306", "title": "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

Most existing work for grounded language understanding uses LMs to directly generate plans that can be executed in the environment to achieve the desired effects. It thereby casts the burden of ensuring grammaticality, faithfulness, and controllability all on the LMs. We propose Pangu, a generic framework for grounded language understanding that capitalizes on the discriminative ability of LMs instead of their generative ability. Pangu consists of a symbolic agent and a neural LM working in a concerted fashion: The agent explores the environment to incrementally construct valid plans, and the LM evaluates the plausibility of the candidate plans to guide the search process. A case study on the challenging problem of knowledge base question answering (KBQA), which features a massive environment, demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and flexibility of Pangu: A BERT-base LM is sufficient for setting a new record on standard KBQA datasets, and larger LMs further bring substantial gains.Pangu also enables, for the first time, effective few-shot in-context learning for KBQA with large LMs such as Codex.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.270", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.270.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yu", "last": "Gu"}, {"first": "Xiang", "last": "Deng"}, {"first": "Yu", "last": "Su"}], "question": "What is the full form of KBQA?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Don’t Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments\" by Gu,Yu  et al., what is the full form of KBQA?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Don’t Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments\" by Gu, Yu et al., KBQA stands for Knowledge-Based Question Answering.In the context of the article, KBQA refers to a type of question answering task that relies on external knowledge bases to provide answers to user queries.

In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop.

SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub-problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios.

By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature.

By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories.

Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme — a procedure for transforming examples into other well-formed examples — that imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same task. We describe a procedure called LexSym that discovers these transformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinary neural sequence models.

{"index": "en-tst-342", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Richeek", "last": "Das"}, {"first": "Sahasra", "last": "Ranjan"}, {"first": "Shreya", "last": "Pathak"}, {"first": "Preethi", "last": "Jyothi"}], "question": "Name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.95_t0.2", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP\" by Das,Richeek  et al., name the benchmark that was used to evaluate models for Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Question Answering (QA).

{"index": "en-tst-352", "title": "Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method", "abstract": "As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score.We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text.

However, pretraining data tends to contain misleading and even conflicting information, and it is intriguing to understand how LLMs handle these noisy data during training. In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs’ learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by

{"index": "en-tst-355", "title": "Learning to Retrieve Iteratively for In-Context Learning", "abstract": "We introduce iterative retrieval, a novel framework that empowers retrievers to make iterative decisions through policy optimization. Finding an optimal portfolio of retrieved items is a combinatorial optimization problem, generally considered NP-hard. This approach provides a learned approximation to such a solution, meeting specific task requirements under a given family of large language models (LLMs). We propose a training procedure based on reinforcement learning, incorporating feedback from LLMs. We instantiate an iterative retriever for composing in-context learning (ICL) exemplars and apply it to various semantic parsing tasks that demand synthesized programs as outputs. By adding only 4M additional parameters for state encoding, we convert an off-the-shelf dense retriever into a stateful iterative retriever, outperforming previous methods in selecting ICL exemplars on semantic parsing datasets such as CalFlow, TreeDST, and MTOP. Additionally, the trained iterative retriever generalizes across different inference LLMs beyond the one used during training.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.406", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.406.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yunmo", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Tongfei", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Harsh", "last": "Jhamtani"}, {"first": "Patrick", "last": "Xia"}, {"first": "Richard", "last": "Shin"}, {"first": "Jason", "last": "Eisner"}, {"first": "Benjamin", "last": "Van Durme"}], "question": "What is the full form of MDP?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "default", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Learning to Retrieve Iteratively for In-Context Learning\" by Chen,Yunmo  et al., what is the full form of MDP?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Learning to Retrieve Iteratively for In-Context Learning\" by Chen, Yunmo et al., MDP stands for Markov Decision Process.In the context of the article, MDP is used to model the iterative retrieval process, where the agent learns to retrieve relevant information iteratively to improve its performance.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Learning", "Ġto", "ĠRetrieve", "ĠIter", "atively", "Ġfor", "ĠIn", "-", "Context", "ĠLearning", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠChen", ",", "ĠYun", "mo", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "ĠM", "DP", "Ġstands", "Ġfor", "ĠMark", "ov", "ĠDecision", "ĠProcess", ".ĊĊ", "In", "Ġthe", "Ġcontext", "Ġof", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", ",", "ĠM", "DP", "Ġis", "Ġused", "Ġto", "Ġmodel", "Ġthe", "Ġiterative", "Ġretrieval", "Ġprocess", ",", "Ġwhere", "Ġthe", "Ġagent", "Ġlearns", "Ġto", "Ġretrieve", "Ġrelevant", "Ġinformation", "Ġiter", "atively", "Ġto", "Ġimprove", "Ġits", "Ġperformance", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [26.843832016, 30.3075561523, 27.1923732758, 23.919052124, 28.6248950958, 34.6722793579, 38.2935066223, 30.2865486145, 26.3992671967, 33.5075454712, 35.667881012, 31.809551239, 33.9881896973, 33.1973381042, 29.6064414978, 33.9745521545, 31.3431587219, 32.1371421814, 28.6544132233, 30.8356189728, 35.0530433655, 28.1235942841, 34.7449798584, 31.3910236359, 26.5730075836, 30.5949401855, 27.9268817902, 34.1271591187, 24.2899703979, 32.7324943542, 31.7166118622, 33.0222587585, 27.1981124878, 22.2519397736, 23.6893539429, 24.2174797058, 33.1205863953, 24.0743255615, 29.7681560516, 35.8411941528, 26.3804798126, 30.9712791443, 27.0221366882, 26.9923152924, 29.4712905884, 24.8015861511, 22.9329071045, 18.0765781403, 21.835319519, 24.0908050537, 28.197637558, 27.341217041, 25.4576034546, 19.4291305542, 18.6757450104, 29.4338302612, 21.1075210571, 19.6881427765, 19.5076160431, 21.0669460297, 33.7250823975, 27.0557250977, 20.3498840332, 25.9735851288, 20.4658374786, 27.1025886536, 22.7312259674]}

Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub-problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise. We show that state-of-the-art approaches struggle to solve these problems with the best model (GPT-4o) solving only 16.3% of the end-to-end set, and 46.1% of the scenarios.

We study one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S., by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of large language models to assist social work experts in analyzing millions of posts from Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing critiques, responses and perceptions. We release annotations with varying degrees of assistance from language models, with immense benefits in scaling: 6.5× speedup in annotation time while only incurring a 3 point F1 reduction in performance with respect to the domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate the value of modeling OATH-Frames over existing sentiment and toxicity classifiers. Our large-scale analysis with predicted OATH-Frames on 2.4M posts on homelessness reveal key trends in attitudes across states, time periods and vulnerable populations, enabling new insights on the issue.

However, concerns persist over the accuracy of these assessments and the potential for misleading conclusions. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs as evaluators for text generation tasks. We propose FBI, a novel framework designed to examine the proficiency of Evaluator LLMs in assessing four critical abilities in other LLMs: factual accuracy, instruction following, coherence in long-form writing, and reasoning proficiency. By introducing targeted perturbations in answers generated by LLMs, that clearly impact one of these key capabilities, we test whether an Evaluator LLM can detect these quality drops. By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average. Single-answer and pairwise evaluations demonstrated notable limitations, whereas reference-based evaluations showed comparatively better performance. These results underscore the unreliable nature of current Evaluator LLMs and advocate for cautious implementation in practical applications.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.911", "url":

These variations may also be caused by transcreation, an adaptation process that entails more than transliteration and word-for-word translation. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-cultural translation on two fronts: (i) we introduce XC-Translate, the first large-scale, manually-created benchmark for machine translation that focuses on text that contains potentially culturally-nuanced entity names, and (ii) we propose KG-MT, a novel end-to-end method to integrate information from a multilingual knowledge graph into a neural machine translation model by leveraging a dense retrieval mechanism. Our experiments and analyses show that current machine translation systems and large language models still struggle to translate texts containing entity names, whereas KG-MT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, obtaining a 129% and 62% relative improvement compared to NLLB-200 and GPT-4, respectively.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.914", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.914.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Simone", "last": "Conia"}, {"first": "Daniel", "last": "Lee"}, {"first": "Min", "last": "Li"}, {"first": "Umar Farooq", "last": "Minhas"}, {"first": "Saloni", "last": "Potdar"}, {"first": "Yunyao", "last": "Li"}], "question": "XC-Translate, the manually-created benchmark for crosscultural translation covers how many languages?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "default", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Towards Cross-Cultural Machine Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Multilingual Knowledge Graphs\" by Conia,Simone  et al., xc-Translate, the manually-created benchmark for crosscultural translation covers how many languages?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Towards Cross-Cultural Machine Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Multilingual Knowledge Graphs\" by Conia, Simone, et al., the manually-created benchmark for cross-cultural translation, xc-Translate, covers 12 languages:1.

{"index": "en-tst-364", "title": "Measuring Psychological Depth in Language Models", "abstract": "Evaluations of creative stories generated by large language models (LLMs) often focus on objective properties of the text, such as its style, coherence, and diversity. While these metrics are indispensable, they do not speak to a story’s subjective, psychological impact from a reader’s perspective. We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM’s ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff’s alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B with constrained decoding scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared the depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4 stories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from highly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit.

{"index": "en-tst-384", "title": "LexSym: Compositionality as Lexical Symmetry", "abstract": "In tasks like semantic parsing, instruction following, and question answering, standard deep networks fail to generalize compositionally from small datasets. Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation of compositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions rather than models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme — a procedure for transforming examples into other well-formed examples — that imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same task. We describe a procedure called LexSym that discovers these transformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinary neural sequence models. Unlike existing compositional data augmentation procedures, LexSym can be deployed agnostically across text, structured data, and even images. It matches or surpasses state-of-the-art, task-specific models on COGS semantic parsing, SCAN and Alchemy instruction following, and CLEVR-CoGenT visual question answering datasets.", "doi":

We challenge AI models with three tasks derived from the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning caption, and explaining why a winning caption is funny. These tasks encapsulate progressively more sophisticated aspects of “understanding” a cartoon; key elements are the complex, often surprising relationships between images and captions and the frequent inclusion of indirect and playful allusions to human experience and culture. We investigate both multimodal and language-only models: the former are challenged with the cartoon images directly, while the latter are given multifaceted descriptions of the visual scene to simulate human-level visual understanding. We find that both types of models struggle at all three tasks. For example, our best multimodal models fall 30 accuracy points behind human performance on the matching task, and, even when provided ground-truth visual scene descriptors, human-authored explanations are preferred head-to-head over the best machine-authored ones (few-shot GPT-4) in more than 2/3 of cases.

{"index": "en-tst-386", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true,

{"index": "en-tst-387", "title": "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models", "abstract": "To recognize and mitigate harms from large language models (LLMs), we need to understand the prevalence and nuances of stereotypes in LLM outputs. Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women. These representational harms have concerning implications for downstream applications like story generation.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.84", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.84.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Myra", "last": "Cheng"}, {"first": "Esin", "last": "Durmus"}, {"first": "Dan", "last": "Jurafsky"}], "question": "Name the 5 races/ethnicities on which the work focus.

In this paper, we focus on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic un- derstanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules.

Yet, there have been few systematic investigations into the ability of large language models (LLMs) to track discourse entities.

We use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking.

{"index": "en-tst-393", "title": "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning", "abstract": "In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of goal-oriented scripts. Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (e.g., “make a cake”), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (e.g., “make a cake for diabetics”). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, Coscript, which consists of 55,000 scripts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the constrained language planning ability of LLMs, especially on constraint faithfulness. Furthermore, Coscript is demonstrated to be quite effective in endowing smaller LMs with constrained language planning ability.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.236", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.236.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Siyu", "last": "Yuan"}, {"first": "Jiangjie", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Ziquan", "last": "Fu"}, {"first": "Xuyang", "last": "Ge"}, {"first": "Soham", "last": "Shah"}, {"first": "Charles", "last": "Jankowski"}, {"first": "Yanghua", "last": "Xiao"}, {"first": "Deqing", "last": "Yang"}], "question": "How many abstract goals are randomly collected from WikiHow?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "default", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning\" by Yuan,Siyu  et al., how many abstract goals are randomly collected from WikiHow?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning\" by Yuan, Siyu et al., the authors randomly collect 100 abstract goals from WikiHow.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Dist", "illing", "ĠScript", "ĠKnowledge", "Ġfrom", "ĠLarge", "ĠLanguage", "ĠModels", "Ġfor", "ĠCon", "strained", "ĠLanguage", "ĠPlanning", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠYuan", ",", "ĠSi", "yu", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "Ġthe", "Ġauthors", "Ġrandomly", "Ġcollect", "Ġ", "100", "Ġabstract", "Ġgoals", "Ġfrom", "ĠWiki", "How", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [26.3249206543, 30.5548915863, 31.7288513184, 25.7832050323, 29.2884979248, 36.0416679382, 32.2489547729, 33.9256477356, 30.2456188202, 36.1797637939, 37.4246330261, 34.1008911133, 32.7183914185, 36.3029251099, 35.2706489563, 29.2968673706, 32.0930213928, 31.3493614197, 35.4323272705, 31.7266349792, 31.9493846893, 27.9329681396, 29.0354194641, 32.9752044678, 27.6135807037, 35.149974823, 30.9152870178, 24.6650371552, 26.959821701, 24.5703544617, 29.9832782745, 28.0560035706, 25.4828109741, 27.3147525787, 27.3748435974, 29.6569061279, 28.6840991974, 31.6980514526, 24.7477321625, 24.237739563]}

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection.

of formality in the language used in the dataset (e.g., formal vs. informal).3. **Domain**: The specific topic or field of knowledge covered in the dataset (e.g., science, history, etc.).4. **Noise**: The amount of irrelevant or misleading information present in the dataset.5. **Source**: The origin or credibility of the information in the dataset (e.g., Wikipedia, books, etc.).These

We propose FBI, a novel framework designed to examine the proficiency of Evaluator LLMs in assessing four critical abilities in other LLMs: factual accuracy, instruction following, coherence in long-form writing, and reasoning proficiency. By introducing targeted perturbations in answers generated by LLMs, that clearly impact one of these key capabilities, we test whether an Evaluator LLM can detect these quality drops. By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average.

While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules.

In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training.

{"index": "en-tst-440", "title": "Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method", "abstract": "As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score.We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text.

On image transcreation for cultural relevance", "abstract": "Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.

{"index": "en-tst-446", "title": "Fishing for Magikarp: Automatically Detecting Under-trained Tokens in Large Language Models", "abstract": "The disconnect between tokenizer creation and model training in language models allows for specific inputs, such as the infamous SolidGoldMagikarp token, to induce unwanted model behaviour. Although such ‘glitch tokens’, tokens present in the tokenizer vocabulary but that are nearly or entirely absent during model training, have been observed across various models, a reliable method to identify and address them has been missing. We present a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model tokenizers, specifically targeting this issue of detecting under-trained tokens. Through a combination of tokenizer analysis, model weight-based indicators, and prompting techniques, we develop novel and effective methods for automatically detecting these problematic tokens.

We study one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S., by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of large language models to assist social work experts in analyzing millions of posts from Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing critiques, responses and perceptions. We release annotations with varying degrees of assistance from language models, with immense benefits in scaling: 6.5× speedup in annotation time while only incurring a 3 point F1 reduction in performance with respect to the domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate the value of modeling OATH-Frames over existing sentiment and toxicity classifiers. Our large-scale analysis with predicted OATH-Frames on 2.4M posts on homelessness reveal key trends in attitudes across states, time periods and vulnerable populations, enabling new insights on the issue.

We propose FBI, a novel framework designed to examine the proficiency of Evaluator LLMs in assessing four critical abilities in other LLMs: factual accuracy, instruction following, coherence in long-form writing, and reasoning proficiency. By introducing targeted perturbations in answers generated by LLMs, that clearly impact one of these key capabilities, we test whether an Evaluator LLM can detect these quality drops. By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in the literature. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current Evaluator LLMs, which failed to identify quality drops in over 50% of cases on average. Single-answer and pairwise evaluations demonstrated notable limitations, whereas reference-based evaluations showed comparatively better performance. These results underscore the unreliable nature of current Evaluator LLMs and advocate for cautious implementation in practical applications.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.911", "url":

{"index": "en-tst-452", "title": "Measuring Psychological Depth in Language Models", "abstract": "Evaluations of creative stories generated by large language models (LLMs) often focus on objective properties of the text, such as its style, coherence, and diversity. While these metrics are indispensable, they do not speak to a story’s subjective, psychological impact from a reader’s perspective. We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM’s ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff’s alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B with constrained decoding scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared the depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4 stories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from highly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit.

{"index": "en-tst-453", "title": "Are Large Language Models Capable of Generating Human-Level Narratives?", "abstract": "As daily reliance on large language models (LLMs) grows, assessing their generation quality is crucial to understanding how they might impact on our communications. This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal. Such advances promise to facilitate greater and more natural roles LLMs in human communication.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.978", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.978.pdf",

Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1051", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1051.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Maxime Guillaume", "last": "Kayser"}, {"first": "Bayar", "last": "Menzat"}, {"first": "Cornelius", "last": "Emde"}, {"first": "Bogdan Alexandru", "last": "Bercean"}, {"first": "Alex", "last": "Novak"}, {"first": "Abdalá Trinidad Espinosa", "last": "Morgado"}, {"first": "Bartlomiej", "last": "Papiez"}, {"first": "Susanne", "last": "Gaube"}, {"first": "Thomas", "last": "Lukasiewicz"}, {"first": "Oana-Maria", "last": "Camburu"}], "question": "How many cases were selected from the annotated 160 cases?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Fool Me Once?

{"index": "en-tst-457", "title": "DEM: Distribution Edited Model for Training with Mixed Data Distributions", "abstract": "Training with mixed data distributions is a common and important part of creating multi-task and instruction-following models. The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations. The resulting model, namely Distribution Edited Model (DEM), is cheaper than standard data mixing and outperforms strong baselines on a variety of benchmarks, yielding upto 6.2% improvement on MMLU, 11.5% on BBH, 16.1% on DROP, 6% MathQA and 9.3% on HELM with models of size 3B to 13B. Notably, DEM does not require full re-training when modifying a single data-source, thus making it very flexible and scalable for training with diverse data sources.

The experiments with MS MARCO and BEIR show that ASC improves the accuracy and safeness of pruning for better relevance while delivering a low latency on a single-threaded CPU.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1101", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1101.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yifan", "last": "Qiao"}, {"first": "Parker", "last": "Carlson"}, {"first": "Shanxiu", "last": "He"}, {"first": "Yingrui", "last": "Yang"}, {"first": "Tao", "last": "Yang"}], "question": "How many English passages does the MS MARCO Passage ranking dataset contain?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Threshold-driven Pruning with Segmented Maximum Term Weights for Approximate Cluster-based Sparse Retrieval\" by Qiao,Yifan  et al., how many English passages does the MS MARCO Passage ranking dataset contain?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Threshold-driven Pruning with Segmented Maximum Term Weights for Approximate Cluster-based Sparse Retrieval\" by Qiao, Yifan et al., the MS MARCO Passage ranking dataset contains approximately 8.8 million English passages.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Threshold", "-driven", "ĠPr", "uning", "Ġwith", "ĠSeg", "mented", "ĠMaximum", "ĠTerm", "ĠWe", "ights", "Ġfor", "ĠApprox", "imate", "ĠCluster", "-based", "ĠSparse", "ĠRetrie", "val", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠQ", "iao", ",", "ĠY", "if", "an", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "Ġthe", "ĠMS", "ĠMAR", "CO", "ĠPassage", "Ġranking", "Ġdataset", "Ġcontains", "Ġapproximately", "Ġ", "8", ".", "8", "Ġmillion", "ĠEnglish", "Ġpassages", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [26.7121982574, 29.5344486237, 26.7036209106, 21.5831928253, 27.4087219238, 33.8828582764, 33.7617645264, 37.2425575256, 37.7191390991, 33.7677879333, 33.9052047729, 33.560344696, 34.9365081787, 36.0969352722, 31.3474559784, 31.3487243652, 35.5764160156, 31.1960105896, 36.6782875061, 34.1365737915, 35.4974822998, 33.9924583435, 30.0632743835, 31.1373615265, 34.2163085938, 30.6072444916, 33.047794342, 33.9209403992, 28.2612304688, 32.1226730347, 32.4929428101, 32.7913856506, 30.3442802429, 34.5180511475, 30.6690444946, 29.5223426819, 25.204788208, 27.8464374542, 32.5753822327, 29.4363574982, 29.2125492096, 32.9014587402, 28.377790451, 25.554523468, 26.9387359619, 21.3001995087, 28.2508468628, 26.5871887207, 29.418920517, 23.3774185181, 25.8021831512, 24.2743206024, 23.8363132477]}

We advocate a careful approach to evaluating these interventions to ensure alignment with human values.In a case study of journalistic coverage of press releases, we assemble a large dataset of 250k press releases and 650k articles covering them. We develop methods to identify news articles that _challenge and contextualize_ press releases. Finally, we evaluate suggestions made by LLMs for these articles and compare these with decisions made by human journalists. Our findings are three-fold: (1) Human-written news articles that challenge and contextualize press releases more take more creative angles and use more informational sources.

Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation of compositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions rather than models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme — a procedure for transforming examples into other well-formed examples — that imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same task. We describe a procedure called LexSym that discovers these transformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinary neural sequence models. Unlike existing compositional data augmentation procedures, LexSym can be deployed agnostically across text, structured data, and even images.

{"index": "en-tst-473", "title": "Do Androids Laugh at Electric Sheep? Humor “Understanding” Benchmarks from The New Yorker Caption Contest", "abstract": "Large neural networks can now generate jokes, but do they really “understand” humor? We challenge AI models with three tasks derived from the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning caption, and explaining why a winning caption is funny. These tasks encapsulate progressively more sophisticated aspects of “understanding” a cartoon; key elements are the complex, often surprising relationships between images and captions and the frequent inclusion of indirect and playful allusions to human experience and culture. We investigate both multimodal and language-only models: the former are challenged with the cartoon images directly, while the latter are given multifaceted descriptions of the visual scene to simulate human-level visual understanding. We find that both types of models struggle at all three tasks. For example, our best multimodal models fall 30 accuracy points behind human performance on the matching task, and, even when provided ground-truth visual scene descriptors, human-authored explanations are preferred head-to-head over the best machine-authored ones (few-shot GPT-4) in more than 2/3 of cases. We release models, code, leaderboard, and corpus, which includes newly-gathered annotations describing the image’s locations/entities, what’s unusual in the scene, and an explanation of the joke.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.41", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.41.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Jack", "last": "Hessel"}, {"first": "Ana", "last": "Marasovic"}, {"first": "Jena D.", "last": "Hwang"}, {"first": "Lillian", "last": "Lee"}, {"first": "Jeff", "last": "Da"}, {"first": "Rowan", "last": "Zellers"}, {"first": "Robert", "last": "Mankoff"}, {"first": "Yejin", "last": "Choi"}], "question": "What are the three tasks that were built to test how well AI models “understand” humor across vision and language ?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Do Androids Laugh at Electric Sheep?

Some examples of tasks that have been used to evaluate AI models' understanding of humor include:1. Sentiment Analysis: This task involves identifying the emotional tone or sentiment of a text or image, which can be used to determine whether a joke or humorous content is intended to be funny or not.2. Joke Classification: This task involves classifying jokes into different categories, such as puns, sarcasm, or wordplay, to understand the underlying mechanisms of humor.3. Humor Generation: This task involves generating humorous content, such as jokes or puns, using AI models. This can help evaluate the model's ability to understand the underlying mechanisms of humor and generate creative and funny content.Again, I apologize for not being able to find the specific article

{"index": "en-tst-474", "title": "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP", "abstract": "Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world’s languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.66", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.66.pdf", "extracted": true,

Models are trained on whatever pre-existing datasets may be available and then augmented with synthetic data, because it is often not economical to pay for the creation of large-scale datasets. But for the case of low-resource languages, would the creation of a few thousand professionally translated sentence pairs give any benefit? In this paper, we show that it does. We describe a broad data collection effort involving around 6k professionally translated sentence pairs for each of 39 low-resource languages, which we make publicly available. We analyse the gains of models trained on this small but high-quality data, showing that it has significant impact even when larger but lower quality pre-existing corpora are used, or when data is augmented with millions of sentences through backtranslation.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.154", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.154.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Jean", "last": "Maillard"}, {"first": "Cynthia", "last": "Gao"}, {"first": "Elahe", "last": "Kalbassi"}, {"first": "Kaushik Ram", "last": "Sadagopan"}, {"first": "Vedanuj", "last": "Goswami"}, {"first": "Philipp", "last": "Koehn"}, {"first": "Angela", "last": "Fan"}, {"first": "Francisco", "last": "Guzman"}], "question": "How many low-resource languages does the dataset that was created cover?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Small Data, Big Impact: Leveraging Minimal Data for Effective Machine Translation\" by Maillard,Jean  et al., how many low-resource languages does the dataset that was created cover?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Small Data, Big Impact: Leveraging Minimal Data for Effective Machine Translation\" by Maillard, Jean et al., the dataset created covers 24 low-resource languages.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Small", "ĠData", ",", "ĠBig", "ĠImpact", ":", "ĠLever", "aging", "ĠMinimal", "ĠData", "Ġfor", "ĠEffective", "ĠMachine", "ĠTranslation", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠMa", "illard", ",", "ĠJean", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "Ġthe", "Ġdataset", "Ġcreated", "Ġcovers", "Ġ", "24", "Ġlow", "-resource", "Ġlanguages", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [26.9944515228, 26.5704727173, 29.7783794403, 25.0225448608, 29.8616428375, 37.1340637207, 38.8482246399, 33.3034591675, 35.6613464355, 37.6793746948, 38.0676803589, 33.0853614807, 38.434589386, 35.5624694824, 36.3688163757, 32.2876434326, 29.2870845795, 35.0435371399, 32.2544021606, 35.9243011475, 31.3901863098, 29.7454681396, 29.7601146698, 27.9917144775, 28.0947971344, 25.8648147583, 34.7472915649, 31.7114200592, 30.3108711243, 23.4378967285, 23.7136936188, 23.4256744385, 26.1381816864, 21.8720664978, 26.5662117004, 31.8717708588, 27.4189376831, 24.5177059174, 24.30219841]}
{"index": "en-tst-477", "title": "Faithful Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation through Cycle Training", "abstract": "Methods to generate text from structured data have advanced significantly in recent years, primarily due to fine-tuning of pre-trained language models on large datasets. However, such models can fail to produce output faithful to the input data, particularly on out-of-domain data. Sufficient annotated data is often not available for specific domains, leading us to seek an unsupervised approach to improve the faithfulness of output text. Since the problem is fundamentally one of consistency between the representations of the structured data and text, we evaluate the effectiveness of cycle training in this work. Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text. We show that cycle training, when initialized with a small amount of supervised data (100 samples in our case), achieves nearly the same performance as fully supervised approaches for the data-to-text generation task on the WebNLG, E2E, WTQ, and WSQL datasets. We perform extensive empirical analysis with automated evaluation metrics and a newly designed human evaluation schema to reveal different cycle training strategies’ effectiveness of reducing various types of generation errors.

It is significant to explore whether Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) know and understand such knowledge. However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge, lacking a system- atic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic un- derstanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning.

We analyze how GANs encode contrastive and non-contrastive nasality in French and English vowels by applying the ciwGAN architecture (Begus, 2021). Begus claims that ciwGAN encodes linguistically meaningful representations with categorical variables in its latent space and manipulating the latent variables shows an almost one to one corresponding control of the phonological features in ciwGAN’s generated outputs. However, our results show an interactive effect of latent variables on the features in the generated outputs, which suggests the learned representations in neural networks are different from the phonological representations proposed by linguists. On the other hand, ciwGAN is able to distinguish contrastive and noncontrastive features in English and French by encoding them differently. Comparing the performance of GANs learning from different languages results in a better understanding of what language specific features contribute to developing language specific phonological representations.

{"index": "en-tst-480", "title": "Entity Tracking in Language Models", "abstract": "Keeping track of how states of entities change as a text or dialog unfolds is a key prerequisite to discourse understanding. Yet, there have been few systematic investigations into the ability of large language models (LLMs) to track discourse entities. In this work, we present a task probing to what extent a language model can infer the final state of an entity given an English description of the initial state and a series of state-changing operations. We use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking.

Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (e.g., “make a cake”), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (e.g., “make a cake for diabetics”). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, Coscript, which consists of 55,000 scripts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the constrained language planning ability of LLMs, especially on constraint faithfulness. Furthermore, Coscript is demonstrated to be quite effective in endowing smaller LMs with constrained language planning ability.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.236", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.236.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Siyu", "last": "Yuan"}, {"first": "Jiangjie", "last": "Chen"}, {"first": "Ziquan", "last": "Fu"}, {"first": "Xuyang", "last": "Ge"}, {"first": "Soham", "last": "Shah"}, {"first": "Charles", "last": "Jankowski"}, {"first": "Yanghua", "last": "Xiao"}, {"first": "Deqing", "last": "Yang"}], "question": "How many abstract goals are randomly collected from WikiHow?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning\" by Yuan,Siyu  et al., how many abstract goals are randomly collected from WikiHow?", "output_text": "According to the article \"Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning\" by Yuan, Siyu et al., the authors randomly collect 100 abstract goals from WikiHow.", "output_tokens": ["According", "Ġto", "Ġthe", "Ġarticle", "Ġ\"", "Dist", "illing", "ĠScript", "ĠKnowledge", "Ġfrom", "ĠLarge", "ĠLanguage", "ĠModels", "Ġfor", "ĠCon", "strained", "ĠLanguage", "ĠPlanning", "\"", "Ġby", "ĠYuan", ",", "ĠSi", "yu", "Ġet", "Ġal", ".,", "Ġthe", "Ġauthors", "Ġrandomly", "Ġcollect", "Ġ", "100", "Ġabstract", "Ġgoals", "Ġfrom", "ĠWiki", "How", ".", "<|eot_id|>"], "output_logits": [26.3249206543, 30.5548915863, 31.7288513184, 25.7832050323, 29.2884979248, 36.0416679382, 32.2489547729, 33.9256477356, 30.2456188202, 36.1797637939, 37.4246330261, 34.1008911133, 32.7183914185, 36.3029251099, 35.2706489563, 29.2968673706, 32.0930213928, 31.3493614197, 35.4323272705, 31.7266349792, 31.9493846893, 27.9329681396, 29.0354194641, 32.9752044678, 27.6135807037, 35.149974823, 30.9152870178, 24.6650371552, 26.959821701, 24.5703544617, 29.9832782745, 28.0560035706, 25.4828109741, 27.3147525787, 27.3748435974, 29.6569061279, 28.6840991974, 31.6980514526, 24.7477321625, 24.237739563]}

This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score.We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text.

{"index": "en-tst-490", "title": "Fishing for Magikarp: Automatically Detecting Under-trained Tokens in Large Language Models", "abstract": "The disconnect between tokenizer creation and model training in language models allows for specific inputs, such as the infamous SolidGoldMagikarp token, to induce unwanted model behaviour. Although such ‘glitch tokens’, tokens present in the tokenizer vocabulary but that are nearly or entirely absent during model training, have been observed across various models, a reliable method to identify and address them has been missing. We present a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model tokenizers, specifically targeting this issue of detecting under-trained tokens. Through a combination of tokenizer analysis, model weight-based indicators, and prompting techniques, we develop novel and effective methods for automatically detecting these problematic tokens. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of such tokens across a diverse set of models and provide insights into improving the efficiency and safety of language models.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.649", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.649.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2024.emnlp.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Sander", "last": "Land"}, {"first": "Max", "last": "Bartolo"}], "question": "What are UNREACHABLE TOKENS?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Fishing for Magikarp: Automatically Detecting Under-trained Tokens in Large Language Models\" by Land,Sander  et al., what are UNREACHABLE TOKENS?

SUPER aims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories.

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

{"index": "en-tst-527", "title": "Don’t Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments", "abstract": "A key missing capacity of current language models (LMs) is grounding to real-world environments. Most existing work for grounded language understanding uses LMs to directly generate plans that can be executed in the environment to achieve the desired effects. It thereby casts the burden of ensuring grammaticality, faithfulness, and controllability all on the LMs. We propose Pangu, a generic framework for grounded language understanding that capitalizes on the discriminative ability of LMs instead of their generative ability. Pangu consists of a symbolic agent and a neural LM working in a concerted fashion: The agent explores the environment to incrementally construct valid plans, and the LM evaluates the plausibility of the candidate plans to guide the search process. A case study on the challenging problem of knowledge base question answering (KBQA), which features a massive environment, demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and flexibility of Pangu: A BERT-base LM is sufficient for setting a new record on standard KBQA datasets, and larger LMs further bring substantial gains.Pangu also enables, for the first time, effective few-shot in-context learning for KBQA with large LMs such as Codex.", "doi": "10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.270", "url": "https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.270.pdf", "extracted": true, "datafile": "2023.acl.xml", "authors": [{"first": "Yu", "last": "Gu"}, {"first": "Xiang", "last": "Deng"}, {"first": "Yu", "last": "Su"}], "question": "What is the full form of KBQA?", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_config": "k50_p0.90_t0.1", "prompt": "In the article titled \"Don’t Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments\" by Gu,Yu  et al., what is the full form of KBQA?
